htmk parser changes

These  are the expectations    after  testing  HTML parser  project  ( 10 days + testing)


1)  Program should  read all html files in  watcher and also  it has to read as and upon the new files are adding to  the Watcher or input directory.(Done)
2)  Fixing the duplicates  to top5timed_events.csv  file, in similar has to check with other  csv files as well.(  as each one writing duplicates for CSV files)(Open)
3)  Connecting to  outlook server  and  able to down load html files into  the watcher/html input directory, and  rest  have to execute as anticipated  with above fixes.(open)
4) below is nice to have. I think I could put some macro in the outlook to automatically download the files in 'watcher'.(Open)
5) It should look for htmlarchive, and if not there, should create it automatically the first time.(Done)
6) Add a htmlarchive cleaning function e.g. delete files from htmlarchive which are more than 7 days old ( number of days should be configurable and you could pass it as an argument with default 7 days)(Done)
7) Remove dependency on C:// directory. Say that the script should run from inside any directory java  -jar htmlParser.jar "..\\awr\\watcher\\" "..\\awr\\AWRDataOutputFiles\\" "..\\awr\\AWRDataProgramFiles\\htmlArchive\\" (Done)
